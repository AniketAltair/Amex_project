# Amex_project

We at Amex want you (the students) to develop a credit risk model 
that predicts the likelihood of a customer to default a payment. The 
Data present for a customer is at any given point of time. We need 
you to develop a model to predict the likelihood of the customer 
defaulting after 12 months. 

#Classification: 
In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning concept 
which basically categorizes a set of data into classes. 

#Ensemble: 
Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines 
several base models to produce one optimal predictive model. 

#Skewness: 
Skewness refers to a distortion or asymmetry that deviates from the 
symmetrical bell curve, or normal distribution, in a set of data. If the 
curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed. 
Skewness can be quantified as a representation of the extent to which 
a given distribution varies from a normal distribution. 

#Conclusion 
After all cleaning and ensembling, we got an overall performance of 
60.66% in test data, which is considerably high when we compared 
to all other teams which had participated in the competition.
